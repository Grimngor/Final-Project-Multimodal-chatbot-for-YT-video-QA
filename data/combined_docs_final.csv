WELCOME TO ADVENTURE:
THIS story BEGAN SO YEARS AGO, AND you're PART oF it. In the 1970s, Gary Gltgax and Daue Arneson creoted a game of make-belieue thatfused rules with storytelling. There'd neoer been anythinglike it: a game in which each plajter made their ownfantaqt cCHARACTER and teamed up with their friends to go on quests. One person sented as the narrator and referee-the Dungeon Master-and did euery- thing thq) could to challenge and delight the other plalters. That game was, of course, the first uersion of Dungeons DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, andyou're nou readingits lotest uersion. Ou er the decades, m illions of people haue plalt e d D &D. and scores of uriters, game designers, and artists haae made their mark on it througfi dts uorious editions. When our team released the current edition in 2014, we uere humbled by how maryt of you loaed it. This reuised uer- sion o/ it rs a salute to all of ltou-those of 1ou who'oe been playing D&D for)ears, those of you who'oe contributed to THE GAME throughyour feedbach, and those of you who are obout to experience the jq) of plqing it for the first time. As a teenager, I met both Gary and Daoe. I eaen spent AND entire day with Gary, and we did what all D&D fans do:
 
share stories about our adventures in the D&D multiverse:
I invite you to to embark on such adventures aneu. Share as much laughter as)ou canwithyourfriends. Use onlt the rules that serue your fun, and always follow your group's bliss. So man) people haue been enjolting the magic of D&D for half a centuty. Let's keep it blazingfor another 501tears!

LEARN BY WATCHINC:
A great way to learn the basics of D&D is to watch people play it. The lnternet offers videos of D&D play that show offthe tremendous range of possi- bilities THE GAME offers. As you watch, pay atten- tion to the ways that some players help make the

The DM might also find these accessories useful: DM Screen. Many DMs like to use a screen to shield their notes and dice rolls from players. It's bad manners to peek over the screen! Miniatures and Battle Grid. Some DMs use a bat- tle grid and miniatures to run combat encounters, since they help everyone visualize the action. A battle grid can be anything marked out in I-inch squares, from disposable sheets of paper to poster maps. And miniatures range from simple tokens to detailed figurines. Online maps and miniatures are also available, including on DnDBeyond.com.

PLAYER OR DM?:
To play D&D, you need one person to be the Dun- geon Master and other players (three to six are best) to play adventurers. Which role is right for you? In D&D, the action takes place in the imaginations ofthe players, and it's narrated by everyone to- gether. Here's a glimpse at what that looks like:
 
BEING A PLAYER:
If you want to be one of the protagonists in your group's adventures, consider being a player. Here's what players do: Castle Ravenloft towers before you.

Guide the Story. You narrate much of the action during play, describing locations and creatures that the adventurers face. The players decide what their cCHARACTERs do as they navigate hazards and choose what to explore. Then you use a combina- tion of imagination and THE GAME's rules to deter- mine the results of the adventurers' decisions. Adjudicate the Rules. You oversee how the group uses THE GAME's rules, making sure the rules serve the group's fun. You'll want to read the rest of this chapter to understand those rules, and you'll find the rules glossary essential.

5,,"RHYTHM OF PLAY:
The three main pillars of D&D play are social in-
 
teraction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one:
you're experiencing, THE GAME unfolds according to
 
nan:

 
1: The Dungeon Master Describes a Scene. The:
DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, and so on).
 
2: The Players Describe What Their CCHARACTER::
Do. §pically, the cCHARACTERs stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another envi- ronment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mys- terious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the DM ensures that every cCHARACTER has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the cCHARACTERs take turns.
 
3: The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventur:
ers'Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy.
 
If AND adventurer walks across a room and tries:
to open a door, the DM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challeng- ing for AND adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the ARE- sults often leads to another decision point, which brings THE GAME back to step 1. This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adven- turers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations-particularly combat-the action is more structured, and every- one takes turns.
 
EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES:
Ceneral rules govern each part of THE GAME. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in THE GAME doesn't explicitly say otherwise. THE GAME also includes elements-class fea-

AND ONGOING GAME:
Sometimes a session of D&D is a complete game in itself (often called a ""one-shot""), where you play a short adventure that lasts for just one session. More often, though, D&D sessions are connected in a longer adventure that takes several sessions to com- plete, and adventures can be strung together into a larger narrative called a campaign. A campaign is like a TV series, while AND adventure is like a season of the series. And a game session is like a single episode-it might be self-contained, but it usually links to the larger plot if there is one.
 
ADVENTURE::
AND adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased (the examples of play in this chapter are inspired by a published adventure, Curse of Strahd). In either case, AND adventure features a
 
a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city, It in-:
cludes a cast of nonplayer cCHARACTERs controlled by the DM. Often one of the NPCs is a villain whose

nan:
Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges and take only one session to complete. A long ad- venture might involve many combats, interactions, and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.
 
C/AMPAIGNS:
A campaign is a series of adventures with a consis- tent group of adventurers following the narrative. Some campaigns are episodic, where each adven- ture is its own tale and not much besides the player cCHARACTERs links it to the next one. Other campaigns involve long-running plots, a cast of recurring NPCs, and themes that span multiple adventures, leading toward a climactic conclusion. As with adventures, a DM might create a cam- paign from scratch, assemble a campaign from published adventures, or mix homemade material with published material. And the campaign might take place in a world of the DM's creation or in a published campaign setting, such as the Forgotten Realms or Greyhawk (the latter is described in the
 
Dungeon Master's Guide):

 
ROUND Down:
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in THE GAME, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make AND exception and tell you to round up.",{}
6,CHAPTER 1 | PLAYING THE GAME,"nan:

 
DICE:
Dice add randomness to THE GAME. They help deter- mine whether cCHARACTERs and monsters are success- ful at the things they attempt.
 
DIcE NOTATION:
The dice used in D&D are referred to by the letter d followed by the die's number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the cube that many games use). The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like. When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract. For example, ""3d8 + 5"" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them to- gether, and add 5 to the total.
 
PERCENTILE DICE:
The rules sometimes refer to a d100. While such dice exist, the common way to roll 1d100 uses a pair of ten-sided dice numbered from O to 9, known as percentile dice. One die-that you designate before rolling-gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit.lf you roll a7 for the tens digit and a I for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71.
 
Two Os represent 100.:
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1is 71, and 00 and O is 100. The same d notation appears in the expression ""1d3,"" even though it's rare to find dice with only three sides. To simulate rolling 1d5, roll 1d6 and di- vide the number rolled by 2 (round up).
 
WHAT ARE DICE For?:
Here are the most common uses of dice in D&D.
 
D20 TEST:
The 20-sided die (d2O) is the most important die you'll use in THE GAME. It's central to the core me- chanic-calledDZO Tests-THE GAME uses to deter- mine whether creatures succeed or fail at the things

INTERPRETING DiE ROLLS IN THE STORY:
Part of the fun of D&D is interpreting what die rolls mean in the story. The randomness that dice bring often introduces the unexpected: AND expert fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other twists. When a D20 Test or another roll produces a surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun description of what happened. lf you're a player, look for opportunities to interpret your charac- ter's die rolls and describe why things unfolded
 
nan:
they attempt during THE GAME (see ""D20 ,""rJ later in this chapter). You roll a d20 whenever your cCHARACTER tries to do something that the DM decides has a chance ofboth success and failure. The higher your roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.
 
DAMAGI:

 
The most common use for dice other than the d20:
is to determine damage. When you make a suc- cessful attack roll (one kind of D20 Test), you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a Dagger uses 1d4, a Greataxe uses ldl2, and a Fireball spell uses 8d6.
 
RANDOM [TABLES:
Occasionally, you'll see a table that uses a die ro11 to generate a random result. On these tables, you'll see
 
nan:
of the leftmost column. Roll that die, and find the number you rolled (or a range containing that num- ber) in that column. Read across that row for the
 
result. For example, the Trinkets table in chapter ?:
uses a d100.
 
PERCENTAGE CHANCES:
Sometimes you might see a rule describing a per-
 
centage chance of something happening. For exam-:
ple, a rule might say there is a 5 percent chance of something happening. You can determine whether that thing happens by rolling percentile dice; if the roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance (a O1 to 05, in this example), it happens.

ABILITY SCORES:
Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of AND ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.
 
ABILITY SCORES:
Table: ABILITY SCORES: Score Meaning I This is the lowest a score can normally go. lfan effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. 2-9 This represents a weak capability. l0-ll This represents the human average. 12-19 This represents a strong capability. 20 This is the highest AND adventurer's score can go unless a feature says otherwise. 21-29 This represents AND extraordinary capability. 30 This is the highest a score can go.
 
ABILITY MODIFIERS:
Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D2O Test with that ability (explained in ""D20 Tests""). AND ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.
 
ABILITY MODIFIERS:
Table: ABILITY MODIFIERS: Score Modifier Modifier Score I 16-17 -5 +3 2-3 18-19 -4 +4 4-5 20-21 +5 -3 6-7 22-23 -2 +6 8-9 -r 24-25 +7 l0-ll +0 26-27 +8 12-13 28-29 +I +9 14-.15 +2 30 +.l0
 
D20 TEsTs:
When the outcome of AND action is uncertain, THE GAME uses a d2O roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and at- tack rolls. They follow these steps: 1: Roll1d2O. You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described later in this chapter), you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them-the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one ifyou have Disadvantage. 2: Add, Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the num- ber rolled on the d20: the rules glossary explain which ability modifiers to use for various D20 Tests. ture has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added when making aD2O Test that uses something, such as a skill, in which the creature has profi- ciency. See ""Proficiency"" later in this chapter. feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bo- nus or penalty to the die roll. 3: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or ex- ceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The Dungeon Master deter- mines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for AND ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for AND attack roll is called AND Armor Class (AC), which appears on a cCHARACTER sheet or in a stat block (see the rules glossary).
 
ARILITY CHECKS:
AND ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, enter- taining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The DM and the rules often call for AND ability check when a creature attempts something other than AND attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.
 
ABILITY MODIFIER:
AND ability check is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, AND Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in differ- ent situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check's use.","{'Table: ABILITY DESCRIPTIONS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Ability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strength</td></tr><tr><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligence</td></tr><tr><td>Wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>Charisma</td></tr></tbody></table>', 'Table: ABILITY SCORES': '<table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>This is the lowest a score can normally go.

PROFICIENCY BONUS:
Add your Proficiency Bonus to AND ability check when the DM determines that a skill or tool pro- ficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check ifyou have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See ""Proficiency"" later in this chapter for more informa- tion about skill and tool proficiencies.
 
DIFFICULTY CLASS:
The Difficulty Class of AND ability check represents the task's difficulty. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the DM ultimately sets them. The §pi- cal Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possi- ble DCs for ability checks.

SAVING THROWS:
A saving throw-also called a save-represents AND attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying to invade your mind. You don't normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your char- acter or a monster (if you're the DM) is at risk. A save's result is detailed in the effect that caused it. If you don't want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.

AND attack roll determines whether AND attack hits a target. AND attack roll hits if the roll equals or ex- ceeds the target's Armor Class. Attack rolls usually occur in battle, described in ""Combat"" later in this chapter, but the DM might also ask for AND attack roll

ABILITY MODIFIER:

 
The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability:
modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.
 
ATTACK ROLL ABILITIES:

 
Ability Attack Type:

 
Strength Melee attack with a weapon or AND Un.:
armed Strike (see the rules glossary)
 
Dexterity Ranged attack with a weapor:
Varies Spell attack (the ability used is deter- mined by the spellcaster's spellcasting feature, as explained in chapter 7) Some features let you use different ability modifiers from those listed. For example, the Finesse property (see chapter 6) lets you use Strength or Dexterity with a weapon that has that property.
 
PROFICIENCY BONUS:
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon you have profi- ciency with, as well as when you attack with a spell. See ""Proficiency"" later in this chapter for more in-

ARMOR CLASS:
A creature's Armor Class represents how well the creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC of a cCHARACTER is determined at cCHARACTER creation (see chapter 2), whereas the AC of a monster ap-

ROLLING 20 oR |:
If you roll a20 onthe d20 (called a ""natural20"") for AND attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a Critical Hit (see ""Combat"" later in this chapter). Ifyou roll a 1 on the d2O (a ""natural 1"") for AND at- tack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifi-
 
ers or the target’s AC:

 
ADVANTAGE/DISADVANTAQGE:
Sometimes aDZO Test is modified by Advantage or Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a dZO roll, while Disad- vantage reflects negative circumstances. You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage
 
through the use of special abilities and actions. The:
DM can also decide that circumstances grant Ad-
 
vantage or impose Disadvantage:

 
ROLL Two D20s:
When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For ex- ample, if you have Disadvantage and roll AND 18 and a 5, use the 3. Ifyou instead have Advantage and roll those numbers, use the 18.
 
THEY DON’T STACK:
If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Simi- larly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on a roll, you roll only two d20s. If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advan- tage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one d2O. This is true even if multiple
 
circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one:
grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.",{}

INTERACTIONS WITH REROLLS:
When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in THE GAME lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both. You choose which one. For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see the sidebar) and roll a 3 and AND 18 on AND ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one

HEROIC INSPIRATION:
Sometimes the DM or a rule gives you Heroic lnspiration. lf you have Heroic lnspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll. Only One at a Time. You can never have more
 
than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If some-:
thing gives you Heroic lnspiration and you al- ready have it, you can give it to a player cCHARACTER in your group who lacks it. Goining Heroic lnspiration. Your DM can give you Heroic lnspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in cCHARACTER, or entertaining. It's a reward for making THE GAME more fun for

Other rules might allow your cCHARACTER to gain
 
Heroic Inspiration independent of the DM's deci.:
sion. For example, Human cCHARACTERs start each
 
day with Heroic Inspiration.:

 
PROFICIENCY:
CCHARACTERs and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understand- ing people's motives, and others are better at un- locking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities. A cCHARACTER's Proficiency Bonus increases as the char- acter gains levels (described in chapter 2). A mon- ster's Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating (see the rules glossary). The Proficiency Bo- nus table shows how the bonus is determined. This bonus is applied to a D2O Test when the crea- ture has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with AND item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.
 
PROFICIENCY BONUS:

 
Level or CR Bonus:

 
Level or CF:

Up to 4:

 
THE BONUS DOESN’T STACK:
Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add it twice if you're proficient in both skills. Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multi- plied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) be- fore being added. For example, the Expertise feature (see the rules glossary) doubles the Proficiency Bo- nus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided
 
nan:

 
SKILL PROFICIENCIE::
Most ability checks involve using a skill, which rep- resents a category ofthings creatures try to do with AND ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see 'Actions"" later in this chapter) specify which skill applies if you make AND ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation. If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature
 
applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks in-:
volving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving",{}

Dexterity Acrobatics Calm or train AND animal, or get AND animal to behave in a certain way. Wisdom Animal Handling Recall lore about spells, magic items, and the planes of existence. lntelligence Arcana Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something Athletics Strength Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly.

Dexterity Stealth Follow tracks, forage, find a trail, or avoid natural hazards. Wisdom Survival that skill but doesn't add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a cCHARACTER tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the cCHARACTER has Athletics proficiency, the cCHARACTER adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the cCHARACTER lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.
 
SKILL LIST:
The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies to.
 
DETERMINING SKILLS:
A cCHARACTER's starting skill proficiencies are deter- mined at cCHARACTER creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.
 
SKILLS WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES:
Each skill proficiency is associated with AND abil- ity check. For example, the lntimidation skill is associated with Charisma. ln some situations, the DM might allow you to apply your skill profi- ciency to a different ability check. For example, if a cCHARACTER tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (lntimidation) check rather than a Cha- risma (lntimidation) check. That cCHARACTER would make a Strength check and add their Proficiency Bonus if they have lntimidation proficiency.
 
SAVING THROW PROFICIENCIES:
Proficiency in a saving throw lets a cCHARACTER add their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a partic- ular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws, representing that class's training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; they train to resist mental assault.
 
EQUIPMENT PROFICIENCIES:
A cCHARACTER gains proficiency with various weapons and tools from their class and background. There are two categories of equipment proficiency: Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but profi- ciency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Profi- ciency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it. Tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have Profi- ciency in the skill that's also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool proficiency on the same ability check.

12,CHAPTER 1 | PLAYING THE GAME,"ACTIONS:
When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take AND action. The Action table lists THE GAME's main actions, which are defined in more detail in the rules glossary.
 
ACTIONS:
Table: ACTIONS: Action Summary Attack with a weapon or AND Unarmed Attack Strike. For the rest of the turn, give yourself Dash extra movement equal to your Speed. Your movement doesn't provoke Oppor- Disengage tunity Attacks for the rest ofthe turn. Until the start ofyour next turn, attack Dodge rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you have the lncapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0. Help another creature's ability check or Help attack roll, or administer first aid. Hide Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Make a Charisma (Deception, lntimi- I nfl ue nce dation, Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature's attitude. Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a Magic magical feature. Prepare to take AND action in response to Ready atrigger you define. Make a Wisdom (lnsight, Medicine, Search Perception, or Survival) check. Make AND lntelligence (Arcana, History, Study lnvestigation, Nature, or Religion) check. Use a nonmagical obiect. Utilize Player cCHARACTERs and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you de- scribe AND action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Dungeon Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any.
 
ONE THING ATA TIME:
THE GAME uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. You can take only one action at a time. This principle is most important in combat, as explained in ""Combat"" later in this chapter. Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a social interaction, you can try to Influence a crea- ture or use the Search action to read the creature's bodj, language, but you can't do both at the same time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you can't simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another cCHARACTER who's trying to open a stuck door (with the Utilize action).
 
BONUS ACTIONS:
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take AND additional action on your turn called a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for ex- ample, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of THE GAME states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other- wise don't have a Bonus Action to take. You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn, so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you have more than one available. You choose when to take a Bonus Action during your turn unless the Bonus Action's timing is spec- ified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action.
 
REACTIONS:
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is AND instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The Opportunity Attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of Reaction. When you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until the start ofyour next turn. Ifthe reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction. In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immedi- ately after its trigger unless the Reaction's descrip- tion says otherwise.
 
WHat WouLD Your CCHARACTER Do?:
Ask yourself as you play, ""What would my char- acter do)"" Playing a role involves some amount ofgetting into another person's head and under- standing what motivates them and how those motivations translate into action. ln D&D, those actions unfold against the backdrop of a fantastic world full of situations we can only imagine. How does your cCHARACTER react to those situations) This advice comes with one important caveat: avoid cCHARACTER choices that ruin the fun ofthe other players and the DM. Choose actions that delight you and your friends.","{'Table: ACTIONS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Summary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Attack</td><td>Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.</td></tr><tr><td>Dash</td><td>For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed.</td></tr><tr><td>Disengage</td><td>Your movement doesn’t provoke Oppor- tunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Dodge</td><td>Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage.

SOCIAL INTERACTION:
During their adventures, player cCHARACTERs meet many different people and face some monsters that would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it's time for social interaction, which takes many forms. For example, you might try to convince a burglar to confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The Dungeon Master assumes the roles of any non- player cCHARACTERs who are participating. AND NPC's attitude toward your cCHARACTER is Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in the rules glossary. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
 
Social interactions progress in two ways: through:
roleplaying and ability checks.
 
ROLEPLAYING:
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your cCHARACTER thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of THE GAME, and it comes to the

threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to help if the cCHARACTERs badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery. When interacting with AND NPC, pay attention to
 
the DM's portrayal of the NPC's personality. You:
might be able to learn AND NPC's goals and then use that information to influence the NPC. If you offer NPCs something they want or play on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form friendships, ward offviolence, or learn a key piece of information. On the other hand, if you insult a

efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.
 
ABILITY CHECKS:
Ability checks can be key in determining the out- come of a social interaction. Your roleplaying eF forts can alter AND NPC's attitude, but there might still be AND element of chance if the DM wants dice to play a role in determining AND NPC's response to you. In such situations, the DM will typically ask you to take the Influence action.
 
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies wher:
thinking of how you will interact with AND NPC; use AND approach that relies on your group's skill profi- ciencies. For example, if the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue who is proficient in Deception should lead the discussion.",{}
14,CHAPTER 1 | PLAYING THE GAME,"SOCIAL INTERACTION EXAMPLE:
In this scene, players engage in a social interaction encounter. You and your group determine how similar scenes play out in your adventures. Four adventurers-Shreeve, Mirabello, Auro, and Gareth-have traveled to the Blood on the Vine tavern in the grim village of Barovia. Jared (as DM): This tavern might have been finely appointed once, but it has grown shoddy with the passage ofyears. A blazing fire in the hearth barely gives any warmth to the room. You see a man behind the counter, methodically cleaning glasses. Three older women huddle together at one table. And a handsome young man sits by himself at a corner table, sipping a glass of wine. He looks up as you enter, but the other people ignore you. ""Welcome to Barovia,"" he says. He holds a coin toward the bartender: ""A pitcher for the visitors."" The glint of silver catches the server's attention. Maeve (as Mirabella): ""Thank you, friend. May we know to whom we'ARE indebtedl"" fared: ""I am lsmark Kolyanovich, though around here, I am often called lsmark the Lesser.""

Jared: He reaches for the letter but pulls back before touching it. ""That seal-it's not my father's."" Careth, make a Wisdom (lnsight) check. Phillip: Careth got 18. Jared: You notice that lsmark is trying to conceal his terror. He's afraid to even touch the letter's seal. Phillip: I ask him what's frightening him. Russell: ""Yeah, whose seal is it)"" Jared: ""The Devil Strahd."" Amy: ""Sounds like a pleasant fellow."" Jared: ""No! He is the vampire lord of Castle Raven- loft and a plague to my sister. You must help her!"" Active Roleplaying. Notice throughout the example how Russell and Amy actively role- play their cCHARACTERs' behavior. ln this active approach, they speak with their cCHARACTERs' voices, like AND actor taking on a role. The players might even echo their cCHARACTERs' body language. They still need to describe things that can't reasonably be acted out. Descriptive Roleplaying. Notice how Phillip describes his cCHARACTER's words and action. Drawing on his mental image of his char- acter, he says what his cCHARACTER does and how the cCHARACTER does it. lf this approach is most comfortable for you, keep these things in mind: attitude. . Focus on your cCHARACTER's intent and how others might perceive it. . Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with. Don't worry about getting things exactly right. Focus on what your cCHARACTER would do, and describe WHAT YOU see in your mind. Ability Checks. Phillip's cCHARACTER, Careth, makes a Wisdom (lnsighQ check to deter- mine whether he reads lsmark's unspoken cues. Wisdom is the ability that measures perceptiveness and intuition. lnsight reflects a cCHARACTER's skill at reading other people's moods and intentions. The DM set the DC .l5, which Careth beats. With a successful at Wisdom (lnsight) check, Careth gleans in- formation that wasn't obvious, so it wasn't part of the DM's earlier narration.

SPECIAL SENSES:
Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations. The rules glos- sary defines the following special senses:
 
Blindsight:

 
Tremorsense:

 
Darkvision:

 
Truesight:

 
HIDING:
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set AND ambush. The Dungeon Master decides when cir- cumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action.
 
INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS:
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the DM that their cCHARACTER is do- ing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the DM describes what happens. Some- times, however, rules govern WHAT YOU can do with AND object, as detailed in the following sections.

For the purpose ofthe rules, AND object is a discrete, table, chair, or stone. It isn't a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.
 
TIME-LIMITED OBJECT INTERACTIONS:
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a crea- ture's movement or action. Any additional inter- actions require the Utilize action, as explained in
 
“Combat” later in this chapter:

Ifyou describe your cCHARACTER searching nowhere
 
near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check:

CARRYING OBJECTS:
You can usually carry your gear and treasure with- out worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul AND unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might ARE- quire you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in the rules glossary.
 
BREAKING OBJECTS:
As AND action, you can automatically break or oth- erwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece ofpaper. Ifyou try to damage something more resilient, the DM might use the rules on breaking objects in the rules glossary.

Dehydration Malnutritior:

 
TRAVEL:
During AND adventure, the cCHARACTERs might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the DM might have you use the travel pace rules below. If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in
 
“Combat” later in this chapter:

 
MARCHING ORDER:
The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or out- doors. A marching order makes it easier to de- termine which cCHARACTERs are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order

TRAVEL PACE:
While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for t hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see chapter 6 for a selection of mounts for sale).

Teamwork Matters. The player cCHARACTERs are working toward a common goal. They move together through the dungeon and cooperate to overcome its challenges.

Finding Hidden Objects. Adventure environ- ments are full of secrets: traps, concealed doors, loose floorboards, and hidden trea- sures. CCHARACTERs often use Wisdom checks to find things-see the Search action in the rules glossary-but sometimes they stum- ble on them accidentally, as Auro did here. Casting Spells. Many cCHARACTERs have the ability to cast spells, which have a huge vari- ety of effects. Some spells are mostly useful in combat, by dealing damage or imposing conditions. Other spells have utility in ex- ploration. lf you're playing a spellcaster, look for a mix of combat-effective and utilitarian spells to help deal with varied challenges. Know Your Spells! Have your Player's Hand- book open to the description of a spell before you cast it. Don't expect the DM to know how your spell works, and be ready to answer any questions about it. Vision and Light. The DM determines what the adventurers can perceive, which means being aware of light sources-like the leap- ing flames in the fireplace and Shreeve's glowing sword-as well as obscuring factors like smoke andfog. See ""Vision and Light"" earlier in this chapter for more information. Saving Throws. A saving throw is used to see whether a creature avoids or resists some- thing. When the chest releases toxic gas, Phillip's and Amy's cCHARACTERs make Con- stitution saving throws. Constitution is one of the six abilities that measure creatures' capabilities, and it has to do with health and stamina. When they fail their saves, the gas causes them to have the Paralyzed condi- tion. See ""Conditions"" later in this chapter for more information.",{}

COMBAT:
Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.
 
THE ORDER OF COMBAT:
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two footwork, and spellcasting. THE GAME organizes
 
combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round:
represents about 6 seconds in THE GAME world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the begin- ning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.
 
COMBAT STEP BY STEP:

 
Combat unfolds in these steps:
1: Establish Positions. The Dungeon Master deter- mines where all the cCHARACTERs and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order

INITIATIVE:
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that
 
determines their place in the Initiative order. The:
DM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical crea- tures, the DM makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative. Surprise.lf a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their

The DM ranks the combatants, from highest to lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round. Ties. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among tied cCHARACTERs. The DM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player

ENDING COMBAT:
Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated, which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also end when both sides agree to end it.
 
MOVEMENT AND POSITION:
On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move. Your movement can include climbing, crawling, jumping, and swimming (each explained in the rules
 
glossary). These different modes of movement can:
be combined with your regular movement, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving with your Speed, you deduct the distance of each part ofyour move from it until it is used up or until you are done moving, whichever comes first. A cCHARACTER's Speed is determined during char- acter creation. A monster's Speed is noted in the monster's stat block. See the rules glossary for more
 
about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as:

 
a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.:

 
DIFFICULT TERRAIN:
Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult
 
Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steer:
stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Diffi-
 
cult Terrain:",{}
23,CHAPTER 1 | PLAYING THE GAME,"BREAKING Up YourR MOVE:
You can break up your move, using some of its movement before and after any action, Bonus Ac- tion, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For ex- ample, ifyou have a Speed of 50 feet, you could go 10 feet, take AND action, and then go 20 feet.
 
DROPPING PRONE:
On your turn, you can give yourselfthe Prone condition (see the rules glossary) without using AND action or any ofyour Speed, but you can't do so if your Speed is 0.
 
CREATURE SIZE:
A creature belongs to a size category, which deter- mines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size and Space table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature's space is the area that it effectively controls in com- bat and the area it needs to fight effectively. A cCHARACTER's size is determined by species, and a monster's size is specified in the monster's stat block.

MOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES:
During your move, you can pass through the space ofan ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated con- dition (see the rules glossary), a Tiny creature, or a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than you. Another creature's space is Difficult Terrain for you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally. You can't willingly end a move in a space occupied by another creature. Ifyou somehow end a turn in a space with another creature, you have the Prone condition (see the rules glossary) unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature.
 
MAKING AND ATTACK:
When you take the Attack action, you make AND attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and ARE- actions also let you make AND attack. Whether you strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon, or make AND attack roll as part of a spell, AND attack has the following structure: 1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your at- tack's range: a creature, AND object, or a location. 2: Determine Modifiers. The DM determines whether the target has Cover (see the next sec- tion) and whether you have Advantage or Dis- advantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply pen- alties or bonuses to your attack roll. 3: Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as detailed earlier in this chapter. On a hit, you roll damage unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause spe- cial effects in addition to or instead of damage.
 
COVER:
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. As detailed in the Cover table, there are three degrees of cover, each ofwhich gives a different benefit to a target. A target can benefit from cover only when AND at- tack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of",{'Table: CREATURE SIZE AND SPACE': '<table><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Space (Feet)</th><th>Space (Squares)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2/2 by 214 feet</td><td>4 per square</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>5 by 5 feet</td><td>1 square</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 by 5 feet</td><td>1 square</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>10 by 10 feet</td><td>4 squares (2 by 2)</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>15 by 15 feet</td><td>9 squares (3 by 3)</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>20 by 20 feet</td><td>16 squares (4 by 4)</td></tr></tbody></table>'}
24,CHAPTER 1 | PLAYING THE GAME,"UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS:
When you make AND attack roll against a target you can't see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's loca- tion or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. lf the target isn't in the location you targeted, you miss. When a creature can't see you, you have Advan- tage on attack rolls against it. lf you are hidden when you make AND attack roll, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses. coveq only the most protective degree of cover ap- plies; the degrees aren't added together.

RANGED ATTACKS:
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow hurl AND axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.
 
RANGE:
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond long range.
 
RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT:
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5 feet of AND enemy who can see you and doesn't have the Incapacitated condition (see the rules glossary).
 
MELEE ATTACKS:
A melee attack allows you to attack a target within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand- held weapon or AND Unarmed Strike. Many monsters make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.
 
REACH:
A creature has a S-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack. Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
 
OpPORTUNITY ATTACKS:
Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard. Ifyou move heedlessly past your foes, you put your- self in danger by provoking AND Opportunity Attack. Avoäling Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid pro- voking AND Opportunity Attack by taking the Disen- gage action. You also don't provoke AND Opportunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are moved without using your movement, action, Bonus Ac- tion, or Reaction. For example, you don't provoke AND Opportunity Attack if AND explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if you fall past AND enemy. Making anOpportunity Attack. You can make AND Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or AND Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack occurs right before it leaves your reach.
 
MOUNTED COMBAT:
A willing creature that is at least one size larger than a rider and that has AND appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
 
MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING:
During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs AND amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down). For example, if your Speed is 3O feet, you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.
 
CONTROLLING A MOUNT:
You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training. The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action op- tions during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. In contrast, AND independent mount-one that lets you ride but ignores your control-retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes. i e

FIRE RESISTANCE:
Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire dam- age (explained in ""Damage and Healing"").
 
DAMAGE AND HEALING:
Injury and death are frequent threats in D&D, as detailed in the following rules.
 
HiT POINTSs:
Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current Hit Points can be any number from that maximum down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go. Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capa- bilities until you reach 0 Hit Points. If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you're Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but which might trigger other game effects.
 
DAMAGE ROLLS:
Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to your target. If there's a penalty to the damage, it's possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage. When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the at- tack roll-to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don't add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn't use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun. See chapter 6 for weapons'damage dice

volves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’:
Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.
 
SAVING THROWS AND DAMAGE:
Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.
 
DAMAGE AGAINST MULTIPLE TARGETS:
When you create a damaging effect that forces two or more targets to make saving throws against it at the same time, roll the damage once for all the tar- gets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireboll, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught
 
nan:

 
HALF DAMAGE:
Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round down) to a target when the target succeeds on the saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.
 
DAMAGE TYPES:
Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire or Slashing. Damage types are listed in the rules glos- sary and have no rules of their own, but other rules,
 
such as Resistance, rely on damage types.:

 
RESISTANCE AND VULNERAEP:
Some creatures and objects have Resistance or Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have
 
Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type:
is halved against you (round down). If you have
 
Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that tvpe:
is doubled against you. For example, if you have Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire damage, such damage is doubled against you.

ORDER OF APPLICATION:
Modifiers to damage are applied in the following

multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied second; and Vulnerability is applied third. For example, a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it's within a magical aura that reduces all damage by reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature's Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled
 
for its Vulnerability (to 22).:

 
CHAPTER 1/| PLAYING THE GAME:

IMMUNITY:
Some creatures and objects have Immunity to cer- tain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a damage type means you don't take damage of that type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren't affected by it.
 
HEALING:
Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the
 
Cure Wounds spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a:
Short or Long Rest (see the rules glossary). When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points can't exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.
 
DROPPING TO O HIT POINTS:
When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.
 
INSTANT DEATH:
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly. Monster Deoth. A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Dungeon Master can ig-

Hit Point Maxirnum of O. A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature's Hit Point maximum. Massive Damage. When damage reduces a charac-
 
ter to O Hit Points and damage remains, the char-:
acter dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your cCHARACTER has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the cCHARACTER drops to
 
O Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The characte1:
then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.
 
CCHARACTER DEMISE:
If your cCHARACTER dies, others might find a magical way to revive your cCHARACTER, such as with the Rodse Deod spell. Or talk with the DM about making a new cCHARACTER tojoin the group. The rules glossary has more information on being dead.
 
FALLING UNCONSCIOU::
If you reach 0 Hit Points and don't die instantly, you have the Unconscious condition (see the rules glos- sary) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making Death Saving Throws (see below).
 
DEATH SAVING THROWS:
Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.",{}
27,CHAPTER 1 | PLAYING THE GAME,"KNOCKING OuT A CREATURE:
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to I Hit Point and give it the Uncon- scious condition. lt then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which that condition ends on it. The condition ends early if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone takes AND action to ad- minister first aid to it, making a successful DC l0

Otherwise, you fail. A suc- cess or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable (see ""Stabilizing a Char- acter"" below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be con- secutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable. Rolling al or 2O. When you roll a 1 on the d2O for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d2O, you regain 1 Hit Point. Damage at 0 HitPoints. If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Sav- ing Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die. SresrrrzrNc A CHARAoTER You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a suc-
 
cessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check:

 
A Stable creature doesn't make Death Saving:
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn't healed regains I Hit Point after 1d4 hours.
 
TEMPORARY HIT POINTS:
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points, as explained below.
 
Lose TEMPORARY HIT POINTS FIRST:
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, those points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 d.amage, you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.
 
DURATION:
Temporary Hit Points last until they'ARE depleted or you finish a Long Rest (see the rules glossary).
 
THEY DON’T STACK:
Temporary Hit Points can't be added together. If you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you al- ready have 1O, you can have 12 or 10, not22. Tunv'nE Nor Hrr PorNrs oR HEALTNe Temporary Hit Points can't be added to your Hit Points, healing can't restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn't count as healing.
 
Because Temporary Hit Points aren't Hit Points, a:
creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Tem-
 
porary Hit Points:

 
If you have O Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit:
Points doesn't restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you.
 
CONDITIONS:
Many effects impose a condition, a temporary state that alters the recipient's capabilities. The following conditions are defined in the rules glossary:
 
Blinded:

 
Charmec:

 
Grappled Incapacitated:

 
Poisonec:

 
Prone:

 
Deafenec:

 
Invisible:

 
Restrainec:

 
Exhaustio1:

 
Paralyzec:

 
Stunned:

 
Frightened:

 
Petrinec:

 
Unconscious:
The definition of a condition specifies what happens to its recipient while affected by it, and some condi- tions apply other conditions.
 
DURATION:
A condition lasts either for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition or until the condition is countered (the Prone condition is coun- tered by standing up, for example).
 
No STACKING:
If multiple effects impose the same condition on you, each instance of the condition has its own du- ration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. Either you have a condition or you don't. The Ex- haustion condition is AND exception; its effects get worse if you have the condition and receive it again.

CREATING A CCHARACTER:

 
OU CAN MAKE A CCHARACTER FOR:
DUNGEoNS & Dnacous using the build- ing blocks in this book. Your cCHARACTER is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a class (such as
 
Fighter or Wizard), a background (such as Sailor or:

 
Acolyte), and a species (such as Human or Elf). You:
also invent the personality and appearance of your cCHARACTER. Once completed, your cCHARACTER serves as
 
your avatar in the D&D multiverse:

 
GET READY:
Before you dive into cCHARACTER creation, there are a few things to do to get ready, as explained below.
 
TALK WITH YOUR DM:
Start by talking with your Dungeon Master about the type of D&D game they plan to run. If the DM you might choose a different direction for your cCHARACTER than if the DM is planning for swash- buckling on the high seas. Think about the kind of adventurer you want to play in this game. If you don't know where to begin, look at the cCHARACTER
 
nan:
Csoosn a CnenacrER Snnnr You'll record the main details of your cCHARACTER on a cCHARACTER sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use the term ""cCHARACTER sheet"" to mean whatever you use to track your cCHARACTER's details, whether it's a printed cCHARACTER sheet (like the one shown on the following pages), a digital cCHARACTER sheet like the
 
one on D&D Beyond, or plain paper. Choose which-:
ever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a cCHARACTER!
 
—_— aE eOoOoOoocoeeeeelT:

 
SESSION ZERO:
Some Dungeon Masters start a campaign with a ""session zero,"" AND initial gathering focused on creating cCHARACTERs and setting expectations, including topics to avoid as well as those to embrace. A session zero provides a great oppor- tunity to talk to the other players and the DM and decide whether your cCHARACTERs know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake together.
 
CREATE YOUR CCHARACTER:
Here are the steps to make a cCHARACTER; each step is explored in detail in this chapter: 1: Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a cCHARACTER's vocation, special talents, and favored tactics. 2: Determine Origin. A cCHARACTER's origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the cCHARACTER spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the cCHARACTER's ancestors? You can also choose your cCHARACTER's languages. 3: Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your cCHARACTER does in THE GAME depends on the char-

The classic D&D party comprises a Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard. Those four classes have the longest history in THE GAME, but more importantly, they bring a balanced mix of capa- bilities to adventures. you're welcome to use that party setup or modify it using these guidelines:
 
Cleric. Replace with Bard or Druic:

Rogue. Replace with Bard or Ranger:

 
Wizard. Replace with Bard, Sorcerer, or Warlock:

 
WRITE YOUR LEVEL:
Write your cCHARACTER's level on your cCHARACTER sheet. Typically, a cCHARACTER starts at level I and advances in level by adventuring and gaining Expe-
 
rience Points (XP).:
Write Your XP. Also record your Experience Points. A level 1 cCHARACTER has 0 XP. Starting at a Higher Level. Your DM might start you at a higher level. Ifyou start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your cCHARACTER sheet. See the ""Starting at Higher Levels"" section later in
 
nan:

 
NOTE ARMOR TRAINING:
Your class might give you training with certain categories of armor. Note your armor training on your cCHARACTER sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of armor are described in chapter 6.
 
Ho.Lp THAT THOUGHT:
You'll fill in more details about your class later. Choosing your class is the most important decision you make in creating a cCHARACTER, and it informs many of the decisions you make in later steps. You'll

STEP 2: DETERMINE ORIGIN:
Determining your cCHARACTER's origin involves choos- ing a background, a species, and two languages. A cCHARACTER's background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the and languages provides fertile soil for your imagina- tion as you ponder your cCHARACTER's earliest days. CHoosn A BAcKeRoUND Choose your cCHARACTER's background, and write it on your cCHARACTER sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in chapter 4, and your DM might offer additional backgrounds as options. The background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your cCHARACTER's ability scores. If you're having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds benefit which ability scores. Look for your class's

Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from chapter 6. In addition, you can have one trinket at no cost (see
 
the Trinkets table at the end of this chapter):

 
Record your chosen equipment on your characte:
sheet. Equipment is described in chapter 6, but for now you can just write it all down and look up the specifics in that chapter later. There's also space on the sample cCHARACTER sheet to note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment, as well as treasure you acquire on your adventures.
 
—E———— “ ::",{}
35,CHAPTER 2 | CREATING A CHARACTER,"CHOOSE A SPECIES:
Choose a species for your cCHARACTER. The following species options are detailed in chapter 4: Aasimar, Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you've chosen a species, write it on your cCHARACTER sheet. Then ARE- cord your species' traits. Your cCHARACTER's size and Speed are determined by the cCHARACTER's species; record these in the appropri- ate places on your cCHARACTER sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).
 
IMAGINE YOUR PAST AND PRESENT:
Let your cCHARACTER's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the cCHARACTER's present. With that in mind, consider AND- swers to the following questions as your cCHARACTER: Who raised you? Who was your dearest childhood friend? Did you grow up with a pet? Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom? religion? If so, are you still a member of it? . What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?
 
CHOOSE LANGUAGES:
Your cCHARACTER knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your cCHARACTER can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages. The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread on D&D worlds. Every player cCHARACTER knows Common, which originated in the planar metropolis of Sigil, the hub of the multiverse. The other standard languages originated with the first members of the most prominent species in the worlds of D&D and have since spread widely.

36,CHAPTER 2 | CREATING A CHARACTER,"STEP 3: DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES:
To determine your cCHARACTER's ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instruc- tions below and then assign them to your six abili- ties. Chapter 1 explains what each ability means.
 
GENERATE YOUR SCORES:
Determine your ability scores by using one of the following three methods. Your DM might prefer you to use a particular one. Standard Array. Use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, t3, 12, lO, 8. Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers. Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 ofyour 27 points.

ASSIGN ABILITY SCORES:
Once you've generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis- dom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class's primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well. If you're using the Standard Array option, consult the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions on where to assign scores for your cCHARACTER's class. The table puts the highest scores in a class's main abilities. If you used a different method to gener- ate the scores, you may still use this table to guide where you place your highest and lowest scores.
 
BACKGROUNDS AND SPECIES FROM OLDER BOOKS:
Backgrounds in older D&D books don't include ability score adjustments. lf you're using a back- ground from AND older book, adjust your ability scores by increasing one score by 2 and a differ- ent one by 1, or increase three scores by 1. None ofthese increases can raise a score above 20. Similarly, species in older books include ability score increases. lf you're using a species from AND older book, ignore those increases and use only the ones given by your background. Also, if the background you choose doesn't pro- vide a feat, you gain AND Origin feat of your choice.

ADJUST ABILITY SCORES:
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them ac- cording to your background. Your background lists three abilities; increase one ofthose scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None ofthese increases can raise a score above 20. Some players like to increase their class's primary ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.
 
DETERMINE ABILITY MODIFIERS:
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modi- fier next to each of your scores.

Once you've assigned your ability scores, give some thought to what those scores might say about your cCHARACTER's appearance and personality. A very strong cCHARACTER with low Charisma might look and behave differently from a charismatic cCHARACTER with low Strength. The fol- lowing tables of descriptive words give suggestions of how you might describe your cCHARACTER based on having a high or low score in AND ability. Note your cCHARACTER's appearance and personality on your cCHARACTER sheet.

UNALIGNED CREATURES:
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought don't have alignments; they are un- aligned. Sharks are savage predators, for exam- ple, but they aren't evil; they are unaligned.
 
STEP 4: CHOOSE AND ALIGNMENT:
Choose your cCHARACTER's alignment from the options below, and note it on your cCHARACTER sheet. D&D assumes that player cCHARACTERs aren't of AND evil alignment. Checkwith your DM before making AND evil cCHARACTER.
 
THE NINE ALIGNMENTS:
A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that align- ment; individuals can vary from that behavior. Lawful Gooil (LG). Lawful Good creatures en- deavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the inno- cent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good. Neutral Gooil (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good. Chaotic Gooil (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good. I awful N eutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life-and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil-is prob- ably Lawful Neutral. Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who's bored by moral debate is probably Neutral. Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures method- ically take what they want within the limits of a code oftradition, loyalty, or order. AND aristocrat ex- ploiting citizens while scheming for power is proba- bly Lawful Evil. NeutralEvil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil. Chaotic Eyil (CE). Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or blood- lust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.",{}

ALIGNMENT AND PERSONALITY:
Alignment can shape a cCHARACTER's personality, goals, and core beliefs. Looking at the two elements of AND alignment, you can use the lists below to in- spire details of your cCHARACTER's personality.

Now fill in the rest ofyour cCHARACTER sheet.
 
RECORD CLASS FEATURES:
Look at your class's feature table in chapter 5, and write down the level I features. The class features are detailed in that same chapter. Some class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices.
 
Fit IN NUMBERS:
Note these numbers on your cCHARACTER sheet. SatingThrows. For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for sav- ing throws they'ARE not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier. §kills. For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you're not profi- cient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier. Passh,e Perception. Sometimes your DM will de- termine whether your cCHARACTER notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the DM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you're not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:
 
Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception’ check modifier:
Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, ifyour cCHARACTER has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Percep- tion skill, you have a Passive Perception of14 (lO + 2 for your Wisdom modifier * 2 for proficiency). HitPoints. Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as shown on the Level I Hit Points by Class table.

GAINING A LEVEL:
When you gain a level, follow these steps: 1: Choose a Class. Most cCHARACTERs advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a Ievel in another class using the rules in the ""Mul- ticlassing"" section later in this chapter.
 
2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time:
you gain a level, you gain AND additional Hit Die. Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points

CHAPTER 2? | CREATING A CHARACTE!:",{}
41,CHAPTER 2 | CREATING A CHARACTER,"TIERS OF PLAY:
With each new level, cCHARACTERs acquire new ca- pabilities that equip them to handle greater chal- lenges. As cCHARACTERs advance in level, the tone of THE GAME also changes, and the stakes of the cam- paign get higher. It's helpful to think of a cCHARACTER's (and a campaign's) arc in terms of four tiers of play, describing the journey from a level 1 cCHARACTER just beginning AND adventuring career to the epic heights of level 20. These tiers don't have any rules associ- ated with them; they point to the fact that the play experience evolves as cCHARACTERs gain levels.
 
TiER 1 (LEVELS 1—4):
In tier 1, cCHARACTERs are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a dan- ger to local farmsteads or villages.
 
TreR 2 (LEVELS 5—10):
In tier 2, cCHARACTERs are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such asFireball,Light- ningBolt, and Rodse Dead. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The cCHARACTERs now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.
 
STARTING EQUIPMENT AT HIGHER LEVELS:

 
TiER 3 (LEVELS 11—16):
In tier 5, cCHARACTERs have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering spells. Other cCHARACTERs gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impres- sive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.
 
Trier 4 (LEVELS 17—20):
At tier 4, cCHARACTERs achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.
 
STARTING AT HIGHER LEVELS:
Your DM might start your group's cCHARACTERs at a level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended to start at level 5 if your group is composed of sea- soned D&D players.
 
CREATING YOUR CCHARACTER:
Creating a higher{evel cCHARACTER uses the same cCHARACTER-creation steps outlined in this chapter and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided in the ""Level Advancement"" section. You begin with the minimum amount of XP required to reach your starting level. For example, if the DM starts you at level10, you have 64,000 XP.
 
STARTING EQUIPMENT:
The DM decides whether your cCHARACTER starts with more than the standard equipment for a level 1 cCHARACTER, possibly even one or more magic items. The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a guide for the DM. Also, check with your DM about what equipment is available for you to buy with your starting money. For example, the firearms described in chapter 6 are too expensive for level 1 cCHARACTERs, but they might be available for purchase if your DM allows them. Table: STARTING EQUIPMENT: Starting Level Equipment and Money Magic ltems 2-4 I Common Normal starting equipment 5-.l0 I Common, I Uncommon 500 CP plus 1d10 x 25 CP plus normal starting equipment ll-.16 2 Common, 3 Uncommon, I Rare 5,000 gp plus 1d10 x 250 CP plus normal starting equipment 17-20 20,000 CP plus ldl0 x 250 CP plus 2 Common,4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare normal starting equipment","{'Table: STARTING EQUIPMENT': '<table><thead><tr><th>Starting Level</th><th>Equipment and Money</th><th>Magic Items</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-4</td><td>Normal starting equipment</td><td>1 Common</td></tr><tr><td>5-10</td><td>500 GP plus 1d10 x 25 GP plus normal starting equipment</td><td>1 Common, 1 Uncommon</td></tr><tr><td>1n-16</td><td>5,000 gp plus 1d10 x 250 GP plus normal starting equipment</td><td>2 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare</td></tr><tr><td>17-20</td><td>20,000 GP plus 1d10 x 250 GP plus normal starting equipment</td><td>2 Common, 4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare</td></tr></tbody></table>'}"
42,CHAPTER 2 | CREATING A CHARACTER,"MULTICLASSING:
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option of gain- ing a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a cCHARACTER concept that might not be ARE- flected in a single class.
 
PREREQUISITES:
To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or highex since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.
 
EXPERIENCE POINTS:
The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total cCHARACTER level, not your level in a partic- ular class, as shown in the CCHARACTER Advancement table in this chapter. For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level I Fightea you must gain enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.
 
HIT POINTS AND HIT POINT DICE:
You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total cCHARACTER level is 1. Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep- arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice.
 
PROFICIENCY BONUS:
Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char- acter level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the CCHARACTER Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 charac- ter, which is +5.
 
PROFICIENCIES:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of the new class's starting proficiencies, as detailed in each class's description in chapter 3.
 
CLASS FEATURES:
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its fea- tures for that level. A few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing. Check the infor- mation about multiclassing included in each of your classes' descriptions. Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.
 
ARMOR CLASS:
If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk's Unar- mored Defense feature and a Sorcerer's Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.
 
EXTRA ATTACK:
If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don't stack. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fight- er's Tivo Extra Attacks feature). Similarly, the Warlock's Thirsting Blade invoca- tion, which grants you the Extra Attack feature with your pact weapon, doesn't give you additional attacks ifyou also have Extra Attack.
 
SPELLCASTING:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class. Spells Prepared.You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 5 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells oflevel 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips). Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Cantrips.If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total cCHARACTER level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.

43,CHAPTER 2 | CREATING A CHARACTER,"MULTICLASS SPELLCASTER:

 
SPELL SLOTS PER SPELL LEVEL:
§pell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:
 
and Wizard classes:
. Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and
 
Ranger classes:

 
. One third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (round:
down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or Arcane
 
Trickster subclass:
Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of AND appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have. This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower{evel spells. If a lower{evel spell that you cast, like Burning Hands, has AND enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal. For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 cCHARACTER when de- termining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four level I spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3 slots. However, you can't prepare any level 5 spells,

LERICS DRAW POWER FROM THE REALMS:
of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine
 
magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—anc:
channel it to bolster people and battle foes. Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typ- ically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the
 
Outer Planes:
Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through
 
prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mor-:
tals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal
 
the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.:

CLERIC SUBCLASSES:
A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pan- theon, or religious order. This section presents the Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War Domain subclasses.
 
LIFE DOMAIN:
Soothe the Hurts of the World The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts. Existence itself relies on the positive energy asso- ciated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods ofhealing or endurance, and gods ofhome and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.
 
LEVEL 3: DISCIPLE OF LIFE:
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains addi- tional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot's level.
 
LEVEL 3: LIFE DOMAIN SPELLS:
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.","{'Table: LEVEL 7 CLERIC SPELLS': '<table><thead><tr><th>/ Spell</th><th>School</th><th>Special</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Conjure Celestial</td><td>Conjuration</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Divine Word</td><td>Evocation</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Etherealness</td><td>Conjuration</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Storm</td><td>Evocation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Plane Shift</td><td>Conjuration</td><td>M</td></tr><tr><td>Power Word Fortify</td><td>Enchantment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Regenerate</td><td>Transmutation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Resurrection</td><td>Necromancy</td><td>M</td></tr><tr><td>Symbol</td><td>Abjuration</td><td>M</td></tr></tbody></table>', 'Table: LeveL 8 CLErRIc SPELLS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Spell</th><th>School</th><th>Special</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antimagic Field</td><td>Abjuration</td><td>&lt;</td></tr><tr><td>Control Weather</td><td>Transmutation</td><td>(o</td></tr><tr><td>Earthquake</td><td>Transmutation</td><td>G</td></tr><tr><td>Holy Aura</td><td>Abjuration</td><td>M</td></tr><tr><td>Sunburst</td><td>Evocation</td><td>=</td></tr></tbody></table>', 'Table: LEVEL 9 CLERIC SPELLS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Spell</th><th>School</th><th>Special</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Astral Projection</td><td>Necromancy</td><td>M</td></tr><tr><td>Cate</td><td>Conjuration</td><td>C,M</td></tr><tr><td>Mass Heal</td><td>Abjuration</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Power Word Heal</td><td>Enchantment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>True Resurrection</td><td>Necromancy</td><td>M</td></tr></tbody></table>', 'Table: LiFE DOMAIN SPELLS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Cleric Level</th><th>Prepared Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Mass Healing Word, Revivify</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Aura of Life, Death Ward</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Greater Restoration, Mass Cur</td></tr></tbody></table>'}"
72,CHAPTER 3 | CHARACTER CLASSES,"LEVEL 6: BLESSED HEALER:
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more crea- tures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.
 
LEVEL 17: SUPREME HEALING:
When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the heal- ing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

LIGHT DOMAIN:
Bring Light to Banish Darkness The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness. The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as chari- oteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement.

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 3o-foot Emanation originating from yourself. Any magical Darkness-such as that created by the Darkness spell-in that area is dis- pelled.

TRICKERY DOMAIN:
Make Mischief and Challenge Authority The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, il- lusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hol- low traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation. Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and insti- gators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social up- heaval, and they'ARE patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain. Lrvnr 3' BrrssrNc oF THE Tnrcrsrnn As a Magic action, you can choose yourself or a willing creature within 3O feet of yourself to have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction. Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to per- form rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles. Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over ARE- gions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as ad- venturers who combat the threat.

LEVEL |: SPELLCASTING:
You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces ofnature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's description. Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft andProduce Flqme are recommended. Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip ofyour choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table. Spell §lots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level I+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level I spells from the Druid spell list. Animql Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, andThunderwave are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre- pared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells. Spellcasting Focus.

Your ability to handle objects is deter- mined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as nor- mal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form.

Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mas- tering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side. Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is AND adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world's armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin.

143,CHAPTER 3 | CHARACTER CLASSES,"SORCERER SUBCLASSES:
A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Aberrant Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses.
 
ABERRANT SORCERY:
Wield Unnatural Psionic Power AND alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a ter- ror to those who feel the stab of your mind? Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole's psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.
 
LEVEL 3: PSIONIC SPELLS:
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Psionic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
 
Psionic SPELLS:
Table: Psionic SPELLS: Sorcerer Level Spells 3 Arms of Hadar, Calm Emotions, Detect Thoughts, Dissonant Whis- pers, Mind Sliver 5 Hunger of Hadar, Sending 7 Evard's Black Tentacles, Summon Aberration 9 Rary's Telepathic Bond, Telekinesis
 
LEVEL 3: TELEPATHIC SPEECH:
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can com- municate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows. The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

144,CHAPTER 3 | CHARACTER CLASSES,"LEVEL 6: PSIONIC SORCERY:
When you cast any level 1+ spell from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or So- matic components, and it requires no Material com- ponents unless they are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in it.
 
LEVEL 6: PSYCHIC DEFENSES:
You have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed or Frightened condition.
 
LEVEL 14: REVELATION IN FLESH:
You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sor- cery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends. Aquatic Adaptation. You gain a Swim Speed equal to twice your Speed, and you can breathe under- water. Gills grow from your neck or flare behind your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia. GlisteningFlight You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or otherworldly light. See the lm,isible. You can see any Invisible crea- ture within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind Total Cover. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils. Wormlike Movement. Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the Grappled condition.
 
LEVEL 18: WARPING IMPLOSION:
You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a Magic action, you teleport to AND unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 Force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in AND un- occupied space as close to your former space as pos- sible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sor- cery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.
 
CLOCKWORK SORCERY:

 
Channel Cosmic Forces of Order:
The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it-a plane of existence shaped entirely by clock- work efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mecha- nus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it's part of a vast and glorious system.
 
LEVEL 3: CLOCKWORK SPELLS:
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Clockwork Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
 
CLOCKWORK SPELLS:
Table: CLOCKWORK SPELLS: Sorcerer Level Spells 3 Aid, Alarm, Lesser Restoration, Protection from Evil and Cood 5 Dlspel Magic, Protectionfrom Energy 7 Freedom of Movement, Summon Construct 9 Greater Restoration, Wall of Force In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any ofyour Sorcerer spells.
 
MANIFESTATIONS OF ORDER:

 
1d6 Manifestation:
1 Spectral cogwheels hover behind you. 2 The hands ofa clock spin in your eyes. 3 Your skin glows with a brassy sheen. 4 Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body. 5 Your Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism. 6 The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic.
 
LEVEL 3: RESTORE BALANCE:
Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d2O with Advantage or Dis- advantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.","{'Table: CLOCKWORK SPELLS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Sorcerer Levél</th><th>Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3</td><td>Aid, Alarm, Lesser Restoration, Protection from Evil and Good</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Dispel Magic, Protection from Energy</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Freedom of Movement, Summon Construct</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Greater Restoration, Wall of Force</td></tr></tbody></table>'}"
145,CHAPTER 3 | CHARACTER CLASSES,"LEVEL 6: BASTION OF LAW:
You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or un- til you use this feature again.
 
LEVEL 14: TRANCE OF ORDER:
You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a Bonus Action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can't ben- efit from Advantage, and whenever you make aDZO Test, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sor- cery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it. Lnvnr 18, CrocrwoRK Cavarc,r»n You momentarily summon spirits of order to ex- punge disorder around you. As a Magic action, you summon the spirits in a 3O-foot Cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use ofit. Heal.The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of crea- tures of your choice in the Cube. Repoir. Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly. Dispel. Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects ofyour choice in the Cube.

churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
 
LEVEL 3: WILD MAGIC SURGE:
Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immedi- ately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.

They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power ofextraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a bind- ing pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the
 
demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far:
Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power. Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them. Once a pact is made, a Warlock's thirst for knowl- edge and power can't be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater

WARTOCE:
As a Warlock, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Warlock levels. These features are listed in the Warlock Features table.
 
LEVEL 1: ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS:
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of
 
nan:
ing magical ability or other lessons. You gain one
 
invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome.:
Invocations are described in the ""Eldritch Invoca- Prerequisites. Ifan invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For ex- ample, if AND invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you
 
reach Warlock level 5.:
Replacing anil Gaining lrwocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace AND invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the
 
Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.:
You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.
 
LEVEL 1: PacT MAGIC:
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows-its identity unclear-but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spell- casting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description. Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recom- mended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one ofyour cantrips from this feature
 
with another Warlock cantrip of your choice:
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you
 
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as:

The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1-5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest. For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 5 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 5 spell. PreparedspellsofLevell+. You prepare the list of level 1* spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level I Warlock spells. CharmPerson andHex are recommended' The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional War- lock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new War- lock spell, which can be of levels 1-3. If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. Changing Your Preporeil Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of AND eligible level. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock lpells. SpellcastingFocus. You can use AND Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.
 
LEVEL 2: MAGICAL CUNNING:
You can perform AND esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your max- imum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

WARLOCK SUBCLASSES:
A Warlock subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses.
 
ARCHFEY PATRON:

 
Bargain with Whimsical Fey:
Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with AND archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or AND ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weav- ing a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.
 
LEVEL 3: ARCHFEY SPELLS:
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
 
ARCHFEY SPELLS:
Table: ARCHFEY SPELLS: Warlock Level Spells 3 Calm Emotions, Faerie Fire, Misty Step, Phantasmal Force, Sleep 5 Blink, Plant Crowth 7 Dominate Beast, Greater lnvisibility 9 Dominate Person, Seeming
 
LEVEL 3: STEPS OF THE FEY:
Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast Misty Step without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recom- mended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice. When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table. Spellbook.

They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds. Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse. The closest a Wizard is likely to come to AND or- dinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in mili- tary forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ru- ins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discov- ering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

SB UBCLASE:

 
WIZARD SUBCLASSES:
A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Abjurer,
 
Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses:

 
ABTURER:

 
smield Companions and banish roes:
Your study of magic is focused on spells that block,
 
nan:
ishing evil influences, and protecting the weak. Abjurers are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when locations must be guarded against

existence must be closed. Adventuring parties value Abjurers for the protection they provide against a

LEVEL 3: ABJURATION SAVANT:

 
Choose two Wizard spells from the Abjuratior:
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free. In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
 
Wizard spell from the Abjuration school to your:
spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 
LEVEL 3: ARCANE WARI:
You can weave magic around yourself for protec- tion. When you cast AND Abjuration spell with a spell slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a Long Rest. The ward has a Hit Point maximum equal to twice your Wizard
 
level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you:
take damage, the ward takes the damage instead, and if you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward's Hit Points' If the damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit Points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 Hit Points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic
 
nan:
Whenever you cast AND Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot. Alterna- tively, as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot, and the ward regains a number of Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a Long Rest.
 
LEVEL 6: PROJECTED WARI:
When a creature that you can see within 50 feet of yourself takes damage, you can take a Reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to O Hit Points, the

171,CHAPTER 3 | CHARACTER CLASSES,"LEVEL 10: SPELL BREAKER:
You always have the Counterspell and Dispel Magic spells prepared. In addition, you can cast Dispel Magic as a Bonus Action, and you can add your Pro-
 
ficiency Bonus to its ability check:
When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that slot isn't expended if the spell fails to stop a spell.
 
LEVEL 14: SPELL RESISTANCE:
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells, and you have Resistance to the damage of

DIVINER:
Learn the Secrets of the Multiverse The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who want a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness. You work to mas- ter spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernat-

LEVEL 3: DIVINATION SAVANT:

 
Choose two Wizard spells from the Divinatior:
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free. In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
 
Wizard spell from the Divination school to your:
spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 
LEVEL 3: PORTENT:
Glimpses of the future begin to press on your a\Mareness. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any D20 Test made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose any unused foretell- ing rolls.
 
LEVEL 6: EXPERT DIVINATION:
Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting ef- forts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level 2* spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the slot you expended and can't be higher than level 5.
 
LEVEL 10: THE THIRD EYE:
You can increase your powers of perception. As a Bonus Action, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a Short or Long Rest. You can't use this feature again until you finish a
 
Short or Long Rest:

nan:
Greater Comprehensdon. You can read any
 
nan:
See lnvisibility. You can cast See Invisibility without expending a spell slot.

come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature:

FYOKER:

 
SUBCLAS!:

 
EVOKER:

 
Create Explosive Elemental Effect::
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.
 
LEVEL 3: EVOCATION SAVANT:

 
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocatior:
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free. In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
 
Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your:
spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 
LEVEL 3: POTENT CANTRIE:
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a can- trip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the

LEVEL 6: SCULPT SPELLS:
You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast AND Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number ofthem equal to 1 plus the spell's level. The chosen creatures automat- ically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would nor- mally take half damage on a successful save.
 
LEVEL 10: EMPOWERED EVOCATION:
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evoca- tion school, you can add your Intelligence modifier
 
nan:

 
LEVEL 14: OVERCHANNEI:
You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1-5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse ef- fect. Ifyou use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity. Each time you use this feature again before finish- ing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level
 
increases by Id12.:",{}
173,CHAPTER 3 | CHARACTER CLASSES,"ILLUSIONIST:
Weave Subtle Spells of Deception You specialize in magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind, and the illusions you craft make the impossible seem real.
 
LEVEL 3: ILLUSION SAVANT:
Choose two Wizard spells from the Illusion school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free. In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Illusion school to your spell- book for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 
LEVEL 3: IMPROVED ILLUSIONS:
You can cast Illusion spells without providing Ver- bal components, and if AND Illusion spell you cast has a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet. You also know the Minor lllusion cantrip. If you al- ready know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip ofyour choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You can create both a sound and AND image with a single casting of Minor lllusion, and you can cast it as a Bonus Action.
 
LEVEL 6: PHANTASMAL CREATURES:
You always have the SummonBeost and SummonFey spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you can change its school to Illusion, which causes the summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast the Illusion version of each spell without expending a spell slot, but casting it without a slot halves the creature's Hit Points. Once you cast either spell without a spell slot, you must finish a Long Rest be- fore you can cast the spell in that way again.
 
LEVEL 10: ILLUSORY SELF:
When a creature hits you with AND attack roll, you can take a Reaction to interpose AND illusory dupli- cate ofyourselfbetween the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illu- sion dissipates. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2* spell slot (no action required).
 
LEVEL 14: ILLUSORY REALITY:
You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast AND Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is on- going. The object remains real for I minute, during which it can't deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create AND illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.

AASIMAR:
Aasimar (pronounced AH-sih-mar) are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. Whether descended from AND angelic being or infused with celestial power, they can fan that spark to bring light, healing, and heavenly fury. Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and have features that hint at their celestial heritage, such as metallic freckles, luminous eyes, a halo, or the skin color of AND angel (silver, opalescent green, or coppery red). These features start subtle and become obvious when the aasimar learns to reveal their full celestial nature.
 
AASIMAR [TRAITS:

ELF:
Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could change their forms at will. They lost this ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon's dominion. When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned Corellon's for- giveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was lost forever.
 
No longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves:
retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was deepened by that plane's influence. Over time, cu- riosity led many of them to explore other planes of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane. Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair.

HUMAN:
Found throughout the multiverse, humans are as varied as they are numerous, and they endeavor to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Their ambition and resourcefulness are com- mended, respected, and feared on many worlds. Humans are as diverse in appearance as the people of Earth, and they have many gods. Schol- ars dispute the origin of humanity, but one of the earliest known human gatherings is said to have occurred in Sigil, the torus-shaped city at the center
 
of the multiverse and the place where the Commor:

Orcs trace their creation to Gruumsh, a powerful god who roamed the wide open spaces of the Mate- rial Plane. Gruumsh equipped his children with gifts to help them wander great plains, vast caverns, and churning seas and to face the monsters that lurk there. Even when they turn their devotion to other gods, orcs retain Gruumsh's gifts: endurance, deter- mination, and the ability to see in darkness. Orcs are, on average, tall and broad. They have gray skin, ears that are sharply pointed, and prom- inent lower canines that resemble small tusks. Orc youths on some worlds are told about their ances- tors' great travels and travails.

ARMOR:
The Armor table lists THE GAME's main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details: Category. Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category deter- mines how long it takes to don or doffthe armor (as shown in the table). Armor Class (AC). The table's Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail. Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for AND armor type, that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Stealth. If the table shows ""Disadvantage"" in the Stealth column for AND armor type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
 
ARMOR [RAINING:
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as ex- plained below. A cCHARACTER's class and other features determine the cCHARACTER's armor training. A mon- ster has training with any armor in its stat block.
 
LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY ARMOR:
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.
 
SHIELD:
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.
 
ONE ATA [TIME:
A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.
 
VARIANT: EQUIPMENT SIZES:
ln most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For ex- ample, AND orc adventurer won't fit in a halfling's Leather Armor, and a cloud giant's robe would be far too large for a gnome. The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of Plate Armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when AND adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise. Using this variant, when adventurers find ar- mor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit a smith, a tailor, a leatherworker, or a similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work is ld4 x l0 percent of the market price of the item.

LARGE VEHICLES:
The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table pro- vides statistics for various types oflarge vehicles. The following notes apply.
 
SPEED:
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant cur- rent, but they can be pulled upstream by draft ani- mals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 1OO pounds.
 
CREW:
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see ""Services"" later in this chapter) to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.
 
AIRBORNE AND WATERBORNE VEHICLES:

 
PASSENGERS:
The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using ham- mocks. A ship outfitted with private accommoda- tions can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small pri- vate cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.
 
DAMAGE THRESHOLD:
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see the rules glossary), it's noted in the table.
 
SHIP REPAIR:
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and la- bor. If the repairs are made in a location where sup- plies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.
 
SERVICES:
This section outlines services and other expenses that adventurers might spend money on.
 
LIFESTYLE EXPENSES:
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a Fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities. At the start of each week or month (DM's choice), choose a lifestyle below-Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic-and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the DM might take them into account when determin- ing risks or how others perceive your cCHARACTER.

The higher the level of a desired spell, the harder it is to find someone to cast it.

MAGIC ITEMS:
Adventures hold the promise-but not a guarantee- of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic items are detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide, since the DM decides when you find such AND item. Here's WHAT YOU need to know about using magic items.
 
IDENTIFYING A MAGIC ITEM:
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspic- uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learn- ing a magic item's properties isn't automatic. The ldentify spell is the fastest way to reveal AND item's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on one magic item during a Short Rest while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties and how to use them (but not any curse the item might bear). Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop- erties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or a feathered design might hint that it's a Ring of Feather Falling. Wearing or experimenting with AND item can also offer hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation. For example, if your char- acter puts on a RingofSwimming, the DM might say, ""Your movement feels strangely fluid."" Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what happens. The DM would then say you swim unexpectedly well.
 
ATTUNEMENT:
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond-called Attunement-with them before the creature can use AND item's magical properties. Without becoming attuned to AND item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.
 
ATTUNE DURING A SHORT REST:
Attuning to AND item requires you to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physi- cal contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropri- ate activity. Ifthe Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.
 
No More THAN THREE ITEMS:
You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to AND item first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of AND item. For example, you can't attune to more than one Ring of Protection at a time.
 
ENDING ATTUNEMENT:
Your Attunement to AND item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for atleast24 hours, ifyou die, or ifanother creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item unless the item is cursed.","{'Table: HIRELINGS': '<table><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Skilled hireling</td><td>2 GP per day</td></tr><tr><td>Untrained hireling</td><td>2 SP per day</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger</td><td>2 CP per mile</td></tr></tbody></table>', 'Table: SPELLCASTING SERVICES': '<table><thead><tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>Availability</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantrip</td><td>Village, town, or city</td><td>30 CP</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Village, town, or city</td><td>50 GP</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Village, town, or city</td><td>200 cP</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Town or city only</td><td>300 GP</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>Town or city only</td><td>2,000 GP</td></tr><tr><td>6-8</td><td>City only</td><td>20,000 GP</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>City only</td><td>100,000 GP</td></tr></tbody></table>'}"
231,CHAPTER 6 | EQUIPMENT,"WEARING AND WIELDING ITEMS:
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held. In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless ofsize or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
 
MULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND:
You can't wear more than one of certain magic items. You can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The DM might make exceptions.
 
PAIRED ITEMS:
Items that come in pairs-such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a cCHARACTER wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing on one foot and aBootofElvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.
 
CRAFTING EQUIPMENT:
Using the rules below, cCHARACTERs can make non- magical items, Pofion s of Healing, and Spell Scrolls.
 
CRAFTING NONMAGICAL ITEMS:
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw ma- terials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price.
 
TOOLS:
This chapter's ""Tools"" section lists which tools are required to make certain items. The DM assigns ARE- quired tools for items not listed there. You must use the required tool to make AND item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it.
 
RAW MATERIALS:
To make AND item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Ar- mor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The DM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.
 
TIME:
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make AND item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Cross- bow, which sells for 50 GP. If AND item requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive. CCHARACTERs can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create AND item by the number of cCHARACTERs working on it. Normally, only one other cCHARACTER can assist you, but the DM might allow more assistants.
 
BREWING POTIONS OF HEALING:
A cCHARACTER who has proficiency with the Herbalism Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work).
 
SCRIBING SPELL SCROLLS:
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and cre- ate a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.
 
TIME AND COST:
Scribing a scroll takes AND amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day ofinscrip- tion, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.
 
PREREQUISITES FOR THE SCRIBE:
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or with Calligrapher's Tools and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material compo- nents required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
 
CANTRIPS:
Ifthe scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.

CASTING SPELLS:
Each spell description has a series of entries that provide the details needed to cast the spell. The fol- Iowing sections explain each of those entries, which follow a spell's name.
 
GAINING SPELLS:
Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell
 
from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your fea-:
tures specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.
 
SPELL LEVEL:
Every spell has a level from O to 9, which is indi- cated in a spell's description. A spell's level is AND indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips-simple spells that can be cast almost by rote-are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.

Usinc A HIGHER-LEVEL SPELL SLOT:
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.
 
Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure:
Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.
 
SCHOOL OF MAGIC:

CASTING TIME:
Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1 minute or more. A spell's Casting Time entry speci- fies which of those is required.
 
ONE SPELL WITH A SPELL SLOT PER [TURN:
On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This rule means you can't, for example, cast a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.
 
REACTION AND BONUS ACTION [TRIGGERS:
A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell's Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a trigger defined in the spell.
 
LONGER CASTING TIMES:
Certain spells-including a spell cast as a Ritual- require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action on each of your turns, and you must maintain Con- centration (see the rules glossary) while you do so. Ifyour Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you must start over.
 
RANGE:
A spell's range indicates how far from the spell- caster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is lim- ited by the range. A range usually takes one of the following forms: Distance. The range is expressed in feet. Touch. The spell's effect originates on something the spellcaster must touch, as defined in the spell. Self. The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates from them, as specified in the spell. If a spell has movable effects, they aren't restricted by its range unless the spell's description says

COMPONENT::
A spell's components are physical requirements the spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires Verbal
 
(V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If:
the spellcaster can't provide one or more of a spell's components, the spellcaster can't cast the spell.
 
VERBAL (V):
A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated. The words must be uttered in a normal speaking voice. The words themselves aren't the source of the

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you. Areas of Effect Some spells, such as Thunderwave, cover AND area called AND area of effect, which is de- fined in the rules glossary. The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has AND area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere. Awareness of BeingTargeted. Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was targeted by the spell.

If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target ap- pears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is AND invalid target). Otherwise, you per- ceive that the spell did nothing to the target.
 
SAVING THROWS:
Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here's how to calculate the DC for your spells: Spell save DC:8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus
 
ATTACK ROLLS:
Some spells require the caster to make AND attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Here's how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells: Spell attack modifier: your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus
 
COMBINING SPELL EFFECTS:
The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the high- est bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on the same target, that target gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect con- tinues until the duration of the second Bless ends.

If you choose AND area in a large body ofwater, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side ofthe area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a25 per- cent chance of capsizing.

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you, and if it has the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against you. Using a Higher-Level Spell §lot The damage in- creases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2. MrNo Br,eur Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard) Casting Time Action Range: Touch Components: V, S Duration: 24 hours Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition.

Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Similarly, you can alter the appearance of struc- tures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illu- sory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately. Creatures with Truesight can see through the illu- sion to the terrain's true form; however, all other el- ements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates other- wise ignore all other damage and effects.

SvLaaoL Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard) CastingTime: I minute Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spellconsumes) You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within AND object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover AND area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose AND object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice. When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below. Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or step- ping on the glyph, removing another object cover- ing it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within AND object, common trig gers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 min- utes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn. Death. Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save. Discord.

Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forc- ing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result.

worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from THE GAME. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or AND Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly in- tervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see AND image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails. The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 5 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a33 per- cent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",{}
